# FemCare

## FemCare aims to provide women from all walks of life easy access to health care resources so they can receive the care they need without any constraints.

## Inspiration
As young women, we noticed that mental and physical health is stigmatized and not talked about enough in our society.
More often than not, women struggle in silence.  From our own experiences and the experiences of the women around us we have noticed a distinct lack of information and support.

## Introducing FemCare!
A website designed to provide women with information on various medical conditions and resources for financial support, a community of supportive women to interact with and consultations with female doctors at your convenience. 
FemCare is designed to be easy to use so you can get the help you need without any barriers. 

## How is it built?
FemCare has been built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP
