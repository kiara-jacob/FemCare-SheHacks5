## Inspiration
As young women, we noticed that mental and physical health is stigmatized and not talked about enough in our society.
More often than not, women struggle in silence.  From our own experiences and the experiences of the women around us we have noticed a distinct lack of information and support.

## Introducing FemCare!
A website designed to provide women with information on various medical conditions and resources for financial support, a community of supportive women to interact with and consultations with female doctors at your convenience. 
FemCare is designed to be easy to use so you can get the help you need without any barriers. 

## Features
- Easy to use and navigable from the navigation bar
- Fully functional front-end website that is mobile responsive
- Login and Sign Up account feature for users
- Health Assistant that is trained and responds to questions about Breast Cancer, PCOS and First-Aid


## How is it built?
FemCare has been built with 
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for the Front-End
- PHP and MySQL for the Back-End
- Health Assistant - Python, TensorFlow, Flask and NLP

## Details of Pages
index.php - contains the main page for our website. 

about.html - is our about page and contains our vision and motto. 

app.js - contains all our functions in javascript. 

login.php and signup.php - contain our login and sign up pages respectively.

## What are we proud of?
We successfully created a fully functional and responsive website that allows users to login and get access to the resources they need. 
We are most proud of the fact that we could built the entire thing in less than 24 hours!

## Future Plans
We hope to deploy the app and add the networking features so female doctors can sign up and provide their services. We also want to build out the forums feature to allow women to connect and share their experiences so they never feel alone. 
We are extremely passionate about FemCare and want to expand on it in the future!
